XAMPP

Make sure you install and run a XAMPP server. You will need to run Apache and MySQL in order to get the code to work. Pull the project into the XAMPP/htdocs directory and then continue on to installing the node modules with npm install.

Using Gulp
==========

Default Task
------------

    gulp

Running the default task automatically watches your project folders for any changes and runs the accompanying task. For example, if you've elected to run tasks on your JavaScript, anytime you change a JavaScript file gulp will automatically run those tasks, including a browser refresh if you've included BrowserSync.
